### **Compile the project**
![minicaldemo.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/7kzMEq/images/4224400854-minicaldemo.png)
(if "Apache ant" is installed into your computer what you need to do is just run following code)
```
ant make // only make the class file
```
or
```
ant jar // build a jar file
```
or
```
ant run //build jar file and run it
```

If you do not have "Apache ant" please use [java terminal command](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/mac-cmd.html) or you may run this project in an java IDE such as [eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) or [inteliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
